Fun with Solaris Routing

Show the route and netmask

netstat -nrv

If you want to persistantly add a route

route -p add 10.37.161.185\23 10.37.160.0 web02 for EMG 2.75
route -p add 10.37.161.179\23 10.37.160.0 web01 for EMG 2.75

It should show up in this file, so on a reboot it sticks
/etc/inet/static_routes
