== Features

* Deploy a single EC2 instance along with the all the resources it typically needs, such as an Elastic IP address, Route 53 DNS entry, IAM Role and IAM instance profile, and security group
* Mount and unmount EBS Volumes on your EC2 Instances for Volumes that need to persist between redeploys of the Instance
* Create a DNS A record in Route 53 pointing to the EC2 Instance
* Configure a DNS A record pointing to the instance's IP address.

== Deploy
=== Non-production deployment (quick start for learning)
If you just want to try this repo out for experimenting and learning, check out the following resources:

link:/examples[examples folder]: The examples folder contains sample code optimized for learning, experimenting, and testing (but not production usage).

=== Production deployment

We do not have any production examples of single-server, as we typically use Amazon Scaling Groups(ASGs) for high availability.

For production examples of `mount-ebs-volume` and `attach-eni`, you can view the link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/infrastructure-modules-multi-account-acme/tree/5fcefff/data-stores/zookeeper[ZooKeeper module].
