steps for doing roles in Ansible

Prerequisites
	be sure if you are deploying a package like httpd (apache) it is in a reachable repo from the ansible server
		yum provides */httpd can tell you this
		you may need to create a small file repo off the ansible server so it can access it
	be sure if there are any configuration files to copy, they are sitting on the ansible master and can be access
	by the user doing the install
	
	cd /etc/ansible/roles
	ansible-galaxy init apache
		this will auto create several subfolders
		apache
├── defaults --> default variables for the role
│   └── main.yml
├── files  --> contains files that are to be copied to another server landing in the directory specified in the install.yml
│   ├── httpd.conf
│   └── index.html
├── handlers  -->  contains handlers for this role but can be reused in other roles
│   └── main.yml
├── meta  --> this is where you set you name and other informative stuff
│   └── main.yml
├── README.md
├── tasks --> where the main list of yaml files that do the work sit
│   ├── configure.yml
│   ├── install.yml
│   ├── main.yml
│   └── service.yml
├── templates
├── tests
│   ├── inventory
│   └── test.yml
└── vars  --> other variables for the role, has higher priority than default
    └── main.yml
	
start configuring the yaml files used in tasks
copy needed files into the files folder in this case httpd.conf, index.html and passenger module
edit the main.yml in the handlers, for this restarting apache
edit the main.yml in the meta folder, put in your name, description, and company name
now create the kick off file that will launch this runapachesetup.yml, in here you will edit which role to launch
check for syntax errors
	ansible-playbook /etc/ansible/runapachesetup.yml --syntax-check
check that it actually loaded and is running
	log into 192.168.1.105, systemctl status httpd
	from the ansible server, elinks http//192.168.1.105

=============================================================
you can also create EC2 node directly from command line
ansible all -m ec2 -a "count=1 instance_type=t3 ami=ami-063a9ea2ff5234 group=forest region=us-east-1 instance_tags='Name=saturn.solarsys.test.net'"
