- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... mdrake58@protonmail.com 
- This repo has subdirectories in it with sample and boilerplate code.  The sample code I created, but do not want IP issues to come up so it is generic.  There are a couple of detailed code files in here, but they come from public repositories and contents have been changed. 
- The ansible directory will contain sample .yml files I created.
- The terraform2 will contain boilerplate code that can be used to build out greenfield in AWS as well as some sample code used in dev and production environments.
- The python directory has a couple of API calls scripts along with other code I use to help me figure out things like how many nodes are actually reachable on a network.
- The go directory is boilerplate code along with sample code I created to start building out a Kubernetes cluster.
- The Kubernetes directory has sample code I created to launch pods and to do load balancing via .yml files
